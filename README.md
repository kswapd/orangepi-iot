# orangepi-iot

## Description
We use an orangepi zero and a LCD to fetch and display realtime crypto currency market info by wifi, and with an additional sht30 sensor to add to orangepi i2c driver, we can also get realtime temperature and humidity.


## Introduction
We have to target currently:  
* 1. Get realtime crypto currency market info from remote http server.
* 2. Get weather forcast report from remote http server, we also want to use a sensor to capture local  temperature and humidity.
Now we have a development kit orangepi zero and a 1.8 inch(resolution 128x160) LCD with st7735 driver. Orangepi zero supports wifi module and one SPI bus.   

## Preparation

### 1. Orangepi zero development kit with ubuntu 20.04 server installed.
### 2. A 1.8 inch(resolution 128x160) LCD with st7735 driver
### 3. sht30 temperature and humidity sensor, we use GT-HT30 to replace it as their pins are compatible.
### 4. Orangepi can access internet  by wireless. if not,  configure file  /etc/network/interfaces as belows.
```bash
auto lo
iface eth0 inet dhcp
auto wlan0
allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
gateway 192.168.3.1
dns-nameservers 192.168.3.1
wpa-ssid "your WIFI name"
wpa-psk 96c41964fd91ab76d00d066c9c437f534a23320c432ac741a22c976e65a94891
```
wpa-psk can be generated by run cmd `wpa_passphrase $wifi_name $wifi_password`, if wpa_passphrase not installed, you can run `sudo apt install wpasupplicant` to install it.

### 5. Enable SPI in linux kernel.  
   Edit /boot/orangepiEnv.txt to add line :
   ```txt
   overlays=spi-spidev
    param_spidev_spi_bus=1
   ```
Then reboot orangepi. if you see spi device like belows, means spi module has beein installed successfully.
```
root@orangepi:~# ls /dev/spi*
/dev/spidev1.0
```
Edit /boot/orangepiEnv.txt to add line :
   ```txt
   overlays=spi-spidev
    param_spidev_spi_bus=1
   ```
### 6. Enable I2C driver in linux kernel.
   Edit /boot/orangepiEnv.txt to add line :
   ```txt
   overlays=i2c0 i2c1
   ```
Then reboot orangepi. if you see i2c device like belows, means i2c module has beein installed successfully.
```
root@orangepi:~# ls /dev/i2c*
/dev/i2c-0 /dev/i2c-1
```

If you want to enable both i2c and spi, overlays can be set like belows:
```
root@orangepi:~# ls /dev/i2c*
overlays=spi-spidev i2c0 i2c1
```

## Installation steps

### 1. Install python dependence.
   ```bash
   sudo python3 -m pip install OPi.GPIO spidev Pillow numpy
   sudo python3 -m pip install st7735
   ```
if installing numpy has error, you can use following cmd:
```
apt-get install python3-numpy
```

### 2. Modify st7735 __init__.py code in pip packages , as it only supports Raspi berry.  
   
   import RPi.GPIO as GPIO    ->   import OPi.GPIO as GPIO


### 3. Connect LCD to orangepi gpio pins:

 |  Screen Pin|	Orange pi Pin|
 |--|--|
|GND	| Ground (pins 6, 9, 14, 20, 25, 30, 34 or 39)|
|VCC	|5v Power (pins 2 or 4)|
|SCL	|GPIO 11 (pin 23)|
|SDA	|GPIO 10 (pin 19)|
|RES	|GPIO 25 (pin 22)|
|DC	|GPIO 26 (pin 7)|
|CS	|GPIO 8 (pin 24)|
|BL	|Not connected|

If you want to your own defined pins, you can find all pins mapping gpio info [here](https://pinout.xyz/), if you do that, you also need to change 
 st7735 GPIO number in the code.  

### 4. Test LCD module by run  python file.
   ```bash
   python3 lcd_test.py
   ```
If there are words displyed in LCD, congratulations! LCD has been installed successfully!

### 5. Connect sht30 sensor to orangepi i2c device
You can connect 4 pins of sht30 to i2c0 or i2c1. You can test and get i2c address by running:
```
i2cdetect -y 0
#or 
i2cdetect -y 1
``` 
to test if i2c device has been configured successfully.
 

### 6. Install smbus 
We use smbbus to connect i2c device, so install it:
```
apt-get install python3-smbus
```
### 7. Test sht30 sensor
 ```bash
   python3 sht30_test.py
   ```
### 8. Add chinese font support, you can put your font libraray.

### 9. Test all code.
    
```bash
   python3 orangepi-iot.py
```
